I didnt do much to the existing code, just cahnnge pictures to appear in a form of  GRID and moved the profile picture to center via CSS attribute (text-align).
I hope to do better next time.
My challange this week was that I had a tooth extraction, so I had to be absent for two days, when I came back I was playing catch up. I feel bad, but I wont let it bring me down. The coming week is mine.
